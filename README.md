# Electricity Price Prediction Project

This project contains data science work for predicting electricity prices using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `project_IDS.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model development
- `clean_data.csv` - Cleaned dataset used for training
- `predictions.csv` - Model predictions output
- `combined_predictions.csv` - Combined predictions from multiple models
- `final_predictions.csv` - Final processed predictions
- `revenue_predictions.csv` - Revenue-based predictions

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project_IDS.ipynb
   ```

## Project Overview

This project focuses on electricity price prediction using data science techniques. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Files

- **clean_data.csv**: The main dataset after preprocessing
- **predictions.csv**: Raw model predictions
- **combined_predictions.csv**: Ensemble model predictions
- **final_predictions.csv**: Final processed predictions
- **revenue_predictions.csv**: Revenue-focused predictions

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `project_IDS.ipynb` to see the complete analysis workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction generation.
